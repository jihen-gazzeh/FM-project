📖 Project Overview:

We commenced with an exhaustive examination of 
TunisiaStockMarket landscape, encompassing its structure, pivotal entities, and regulatory environment. 

🔎 Analytical Depth:

We conducted a rigorous MacroeconomicAnalysis on 58 publicly listed companies on the TunisStockExchange. Our objective was to identify firms with strong potential for growth and investment. 
Narrowing down to 20 firms, we embarked on a deep dive into their financial health and stock performance over the last decade, leveraging FinancialStatementAnalysis and stock performance metrics.

📈 Technical Analysis and Modeling:

Our TechnicalAnalysis incorporated a variety of indicators, including DailyReturns, BollingerBands, and MACD, supported by a bespoke 
Python model. This model included libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and was instrumental in predicting stock prices and building a momentum trading algorithm.

💼 Strategic Application and Investment:

The application of the MarkowitzPortfolioTheory facilitated the identification of 8 companies with strong investment potential. Subsequent investment decisions were made after a thorough analysis of market entry points, executed through a meticulously selected broker.

🔍Evaluation and Risk Management:

The project has ended with an extensive evaluation of the investment outcomes, including RiskAssessment, Benchmarking with Tunindex,KRIs and KPIs analysis, and AttributionAnalysis, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the project’s impact.

This work was a collaborative effort alongside my teammates Takoua Hmidi, Emna Megdiche, and Azza Karchoud, whose contribution and dedication were invaluable
